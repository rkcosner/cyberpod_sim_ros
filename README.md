# cyberpod_sim_ros
The majority of this code was original written by Andrew Singleterry. Adjustments were made by Ryan Cosner and Sarah Dean for use in producing the experimental results for their CoRL 2020 submission titled "Guaranteeing Safety of Learned Perception Modulesvia Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Functions" [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16001.pdf).

To install and run this package, you'll need to clone the [**rviz_camera_stream**](https://github.com/lucasw/rviz_camera_stream.git) repo and the [**rviz_lighting**](https://github.com/mogumbo/rviz_lighting.git) repo into the src file of your catkin workspace. You'll also need the Python [**ECOS**](https://github.com/embotech/ecos-python) package which can be installed via: 
> 'pip install ecos'

<!--
## Install OSQP_embedded 
*clone from bitbucket*
*enter directory*
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
 
## Install ASIF++ 
*clone from bitbucket* 
*go to directory*
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
ccmake . 
*change osqp_embedded to true*
sudo make install
-->

## Running repo
<!--
* go to top level of catkin workspace
* 'catkin_make' whenever code changes -->
* *cd catkin_workspace* go to the top level of the catkin workspace
* *source devel/setup.bash*
* *roslaunch cyberpod_sim_ros ecos.launch*
* open a new terminal 
* *source devel/setup.bash* in the new terminal 
* start the simulation using the command: *rosservice call /cyberpod_sim_ros/integrator/ui "cmd: 1 
data:-0"*
  * The commands values are: 0 stops, 1 starts, 4 resets

## Recordings
Recordings will appear in the */bags* folder in the repo and in that folder is another readme for how to format the data.

## Key Features of Main Simulation: 
***ecos.launch*** 
    launches the main simulation 

***dynamics.hpp*** 
    the dynamics for the cyberpod as derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations

***msg/***
    the four messages listed above are the custom messages used to relay messages between the nodes of simulation and also between the user and the system 

***srv/ui.srv***
    the service for the user to interact with the simulation

***URDF***
    the system's visual model rviz visualisations 

**Nodes:**
* integrator_node.cpp
    * serves as the main physics engine for the system, receives inputs from ecos_filter_node and outputs integrated states 
* perception_node.py 
    * recieves image data and outputs state estimates
* sensor_node.cpp
    * receives state values from integrator node state estimates from perception_node and outputs "measured states" with true state values used whenever they cannot be attained from the image, such as velocity. 
* controller_node.cpp
    * receives state estimates and output desired input based on PD feedback gains
* ecos_filter_node.py 
    * receives state estimates and desired input and outputs minimally adjusted input to guarantee safety 


## Main Code for Data Collection 
* sample_state_space.launch
    * launch data collection procedure
* grid_state_space_node.cpp
    * iterates through a gridding of the state space
